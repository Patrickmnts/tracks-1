# Adventure Tracks

Hi! In this repository lives the GPS tracks for trips I've taken on [my motorcycle](http://chrshnt.com/my-tiger). You are free to download and ride these yourself and can find photos from most of these trips on my Instagram account: [instagram.com/huntca](https://instagram.com/huntca/).

Download the [gpx archive](https://github.com/chrishunt/tracks/tree/gh-pages/gpx) and peruse in your GPS viewer of choice, or pull up [a map](http://chrishunt.co/tracks/map.html?2015-09-12&2015-09-13,ff00b4&2015-09-14,ae00ff) using the URL syntax I've described below.

## Examples

Here's a scenic loop around the Olympic Peninsula in Washington that was ridden from `2015-09-12` to `2015-09-14`. Notice that I've included color information in the URL as well. By default, all tracks will be displayed in `#FF0000` (red).

And here's a loop around Oregon that was toured with my wife in August 2015. The tracks have been given different colors here so each day can be seen clearly.
